# Plan

I need a NodeJS CLI that proposes me to commit all pending changes on my git repo and auto-generates the commit message.

- It uses OpenRouter with Gemini 2.5
- I should be able to confirm/refuse before commit creation
- I should be able to adjust (follow-up) before final confirmation
- I should be able to run CLI with "commiat" (no arguments)
